This notebook explores the Social Progress Indices and their relevant numerical measurement values for different social progress categories for all countries around the globe. The Social Progress Index is determined by three main Social Progress Principle categories of Basic Human Needs, Foundations of Wellbeing, and Opportunity, which is rated out of 100. These categories then have subcategories whose numerical values and range differ depending on the statistic observed.
